# üß† AI-Powered Google Maps Scraper Using n8n + OpenAI + Apify

This project is a no-code/low-code automation built using [n8n](https://n8n.io/) that lets you scrape real-world business data from Google Maps using a simple natural language prompt.

With the help of an AI agent (powered by OpenAI), a Google Maps scraper (via Apify), and live Google Sheets integration, this workflow supports:

‚úÖ Lead generation  
‚úÖ Local market research  
‚úÖ Outreach targeting

##  What It Does

1. **Accepts a simple user prompt**, like:  
   _‚ÄúScrape barbershops in Fredericton, New Brunswick‚Äù_

2. The **AI Agent (OpenAI GPT-3.5)** interprets your message and extracts:
   - Industry/business type
   - City
   - Province
   - Country

3. It then **calls another workflow** that:
   - Sends these details to Apify to start a Google Maps scraping task
   - Waits for the scraping job to finish
   - Fetches the business data (up to 50 listings)

4. Finally, it **writes the results directly to Google Sheets**, including:
   - Name, Phone Number, Website, City, Service, and Platform
